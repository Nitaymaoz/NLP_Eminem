Infinite,"[Produced by Mr. Porter & Jeff Bass]

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MCs, MCs)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm infinite

[Chorus]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
Some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MCs are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently
Sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite

[Chorus]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be
‘Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm infinite

[Chorus]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm infinite

It’s O.K.,"[Intro: Proof & Eminem]
Check it out!
Hey, Kyu!

[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (Can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 1: Eminem]
One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried
'Til I'm glad to be buried and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be plannin' this stuff
'Cause I'm still strugglin', hard to be the man, and it's tough
'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up
The minute shit hits the fan and erupts
I'm antein' up, double or nothin'
I've been troubled enough and I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
See, my destiny's to rest in ease
'Til I'm impressed and pleased with my progress I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you're steppin' on turf, Kyu

[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for keeps
Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheap
Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth
Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughterin' house
Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make 'em do shit illegal for these Grants and Jacksons
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mopin' depressed
Always gropin' a mess or flyin' over the nest
To sellin' dope with the rest
I quit smokin' cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets
I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day, but everything is okay (It's okay)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here (Belong here)

[Outro: Eye-Kyu]
Uh, it's okay
Yeah, it's alright
Even though I can't sleep
Uh, yeah, it's okay
It's alright, I can't sleep
Hmm, it's cool",Infinite
Tonite,"[Produced by Mr. Porter]

[Verse 1]
I'm givin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs
Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs
Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs, unravelin' facts
And gravel in cracks to find babblin' Max, gafflin' tracks
I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts
Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Stealin' my art when I sculpt it
The culprit that stole shit'll end up with his skull split
Then I bury the hatchet, I carry the fat shit
Butter Fingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

[Chorus]
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright

[Verse 2]
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalers
Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' limelighters
I think we live an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By usin' a special fusion of chemical solution for this fresh illusion
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back
Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act
When I rep-a-resent it and will have a referee in it
Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it

[Chorus]
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright

[Verse 3]
Eminem is headed skyward
For those who thought that I would
Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas
And showed you all how wack you was
I meant it as a diss
'Cause you don't posses the pizzazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you addin' fuel to the fire, I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical
To my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
When I'm enchantin' with a romantically
Freakin' vocal so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here
Just be like

[Chorus]
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
'Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Till the morning light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright",Infinite
313,"[Chorus: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC? You gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one, see?
Man, what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you're 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC? You better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see?

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo, some people say I'm wack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest wack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime
My slick a cappella sounds clever with the beats
Boy, I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the street
Forget a gold digger's succubus
My soul's thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more different strokes than Phillip Drummond
On open mic I bone your woman just to keep my lyrics comin' (Bitch!)
We elevated to new heights, premeditated
Let it be that I stated, they hate it
Now that they see that I made it
He escalated, can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it
So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick, all you so-called hard MCs would not be impotent, but pimpin' it
And actin' like you could rock a show (So?)
Harder than LL's ""Rock the Bells"" and you's a ho
Now, everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My lines they keep comin' like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got somethin' for your ass to hate
I blast your hate and have you all runnin' past the gates
And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows
I got 'em open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' 'em hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance? No, we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring 'em some of this real hip-hop
I'll drop beats and you ain't singin' and I do my thing and run
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit flow
Yo, you need to come with them real skills and act like you know

[Chorus: Eminem & Eye-Kyu]
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC? You better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see?
Now what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills you 'bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC? You better become me
If you ever wanna be one, see?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Look, so what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
You don't know shit so when you see one, flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot
I make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fuckin' memory
It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed
Your will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'd be billed
My facility's filled with fans packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty (Ha)
If he's actin' soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner than Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang simple as ABC's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MCs and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, biters get treated with shots
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours, let's see what you got
But don't front, and never try to be what you're not
'Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack

[Chorus: Eye-Kyu & Eminem]
Now what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?
None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC? You'll never become me
So you ain't never gonna be one, see?
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?
None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC? You'll never become me
So you ain't never gonna be one, see?",Infinite

[Intro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Maxine!
Hello
Can I speak to Maxine?
Yeah, this is me, what's up?
What up?
Who dis?
Denaun
Yeah, what's up?
What are you doing?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Huh?
Nothing, just laying in bed
Why?
I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency 'cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, 'cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it

[Verse 2: Denaun Porter]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?
That is to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids
Shit, you livin' trife
Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop
But it just… slows… down…
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hidin' in your closet?
I refrain from gettin' angry, but you keep on actin' strangely

[Verse 3: Three]
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Spit game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat
And said: ""Hey, bitch, haven't I seen you before?""
Looked at my nigga, turned around and got slapped
Threw out my hands, and said: ""Oh, it's like that?""
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine (Maxine!)
So I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine too
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation
That's when she asked me could I fuck
I said: ""Maxine, check this out
Give me your address, I'll be through, and you'll find out""
Got to the crib, she let me in
She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand
And proceeded to the bedroom
I said, ""Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things!
What the fuck are you doin'?!"" So I went for my protection
Took off my clothes and started flexin'
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work
Before I hit it she said: ""3, don't get mad
But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your ass""
I said, ""What is it? Another nigga? It's okay""
She said: ""No, I forgot to tell you
That I got AIDS, I got a problem.""

[Outro: Maxine & Denaun Porter]
Hey, Maxine
What?
You thinkin' about suckin' my dick?
Yeah, for a small price
For a small price? What you mean?
You know, money, nigga
You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
What you, what you hear I got?
AIDS
Who told you that bullshit?
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Oh, for real, it's like that?
Well, I ain't got shit, so he ain't got shit
And if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fuckin' around with no third, nigga
Fuck that, I ain't fuckin' with you
No, see…
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Hold on, why it ain't even like that
I want y'all to get paid, fuckin'",Infinite

What?!? I ain't wack, nigga, I got some raps for all y'all

You can bust yours after me if you want to
No, no, man, I'm goin' first

I'll have you taken back to Christ when you're sacrificed
The way you're hacked and sliced
When I fill your back with knives
Jackin' life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowin' up the stage with illegal contraband
I stomped your man, so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steamin' like a teapot
I make the D hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazin' task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no remorse for ya
When I torture ya throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya
You couldn't flip shit playin' in toilets with a spatula

[Chorus: Thyme & Treach]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, bitch, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(I wanna know, wanna know)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespectin' me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a TEC to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior deteriorate like bacteria
Materially, killin' serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and feel your jaw get stiffer and ache
Wither and break, you slitherin' snake
Gibberin' fake, fibber and flake
I'll twist you in a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake for fisherman's sake
If this is a dream, you wish you can wake every diss you can take
Personal, we ain't friends tryin' to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate, you can take offense
I make intense masterpieces
And smash to pieces your last releases
You pass diseases, that's the reason
I'm showin' you the proper way to
Operate a mic, so pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severin' flesh of fools who never impressed ever infest

[Chorus: Thyme & Treach]
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out, man, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic, man, and said that you can flow?
Point him out, bitch, I wanna know!
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?

Denaun, what up, man?
What up, dawg?
You all right?
Chillin', it's cold as Hell
Yes, it is, hey, bus didn't come here, did it?
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store right quick, man, 'cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look
You should just–, how much you got there?
I only got seventy-five (And I mean–)
And you know what I'm sayin'?
I got a dollar, you know what I mean?
Just throw it in there, they ain't gonna know
You know what? (C'mon)
Ayy, look, I'm sick of takin' this damn bus everywhere, man
You gotta make some moves or somethin'
I know, look, I'm tryna get rich
I got a baby on the way, I ain't even got a car
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm still stayin' with my moms, man
Twenty-one stayin' in my old crib, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, look, hey, we gotta make some hit records or somethin'
You know what I'm sayin'? (I'm ready)
'Cause I'm tired of bein' broke

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of havin' a turn to earn money to burn
Mappin' out my strategies to get rich, huh
My desire's like a scratch that needs to get itched, huh
'Cause, man, I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothin's different to me, so what else is there to see?
I'll be the prisoner to flee from all of this misery
I'm not wishin' to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me for this and agree
You're missin' the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally, my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you, the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours or a mission-less course
When your shit is in the stores, 'cause you can be a star

[Chorus: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh?
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh?
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh?

[Interlude: Eminem & Denaun]
You know what I'm sayin'? See what I'm talkin' about, man?
It's that simple, yeah
A million dollars ain't even that far away, really
You know we got to get the money, man I can't be broke for the rest of my life, man
Yeah, I hear what you're sayin'
Look, there's gotta be somethin' better, you know what I'm sayin'?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life, man
Bummin' rides everywhere I go, yeah
What's up with Lexuses and Land Cruisers? Haha

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ayo, I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handlin' business
I'm cancelin' Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for a stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose a few that I trust
Them's the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta Philpot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life: my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through in the nine
My crew's true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or bein' wanted like fugitives
It's all about a man plannin' what his future is
What he can do for his, to be a star

[Chorus: Eminem]
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh?
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh?
'Cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you, baby, 'cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are
You're never too far from revenue, huh?

[Outro: Eminem & Denaun]
That's what I'm talkin' about
I'm not tryna be the player, I'm tryna be the mayor, haha
I want to be president, yo man, forget bein' president, man
I'm tryna be king, makin' dead presidents
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Gettin' money any time I want, ownin' my own businesses and all that
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, I'm tryna be a millionaire, baby
Hahaha, It's all on you though

I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness and the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin', I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
Interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run (*Laughter*)
The way your lips sparkle, and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin', you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush and answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree, then repeat after me
""I love you"" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you, nowhere to be found

[Verse 2: Eye-Kyu]
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a date up, so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Time enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pérignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze (Izze), the Bacardi and Hurricane
If daiquiris ain't in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tanqueray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the woman that I'm speakin' to, squo
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do, so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the négligée

Backstabber,"[Intro: Police Scanner]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming after your girlfriend next

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

[Chorus: Proof, Craig Mack & LL Cool J]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all, be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Chorus: Proof, Craig Mack & LL Cool J]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
""Give me your girlfriend, or I'm gonna kill ya!""

[Chorus: Proof, Craig Mack & LL Cool J]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Chorus: Proof, Craig Mack & LL Cool J]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

[Interlude: Police Scanner]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done!

[Interlude]
Jealous?
What he mean ""jealous""? You know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes, and they ain't got no money
No vibe, no dick, I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time, he has no career move, I mean—

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company, now you're always pumpin' me
For information, and you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
'Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind
Say what?—

He just mad 'cause I'm gettin' it all night, jealous of me
Know what I'm sayin'? That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just clock in this pussy, pfft

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feetprints
And tappin' in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense: there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, ""Who was Mike?"" And you was like
""I need a new nigga! Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow!""
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughingstock, but now, I'm on my feet again
And so, we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, ""You didn't want me to see yo' hon, don't want me now
Take the towel, wipe your brow!"" Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now you're tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and every time you made me bawl my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'all— fellas, sing it!

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans

(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)

And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink

You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'

Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?

These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
""I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse""
""What's the matter?""
""I don't know, my leg, it hurts""
""Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy""
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee""
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework""
""But don't you wanna give me after school detention?""
""Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him""

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die, honky""
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug"" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look, bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry, son""
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

[Chorus]

If I Had,"[Intro]
""Life,"" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground (If I had a million)
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
In disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny, money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
Tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square, tired of not bein' a millionaire

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics (If I had a million dollars)
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john (I could set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke, and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
Tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', ""Where hip-hop lives"" (Where hip-hop lives)

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics (If I had a million dollars)
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john (I would set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit (If I had a million dollars)
Tellin' me to be positive, how am I 'posed to be positive
When I don't see shit positive? You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see (If I had a million dollars)
You know what I'm sayin'? Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city (You could share my wealth with me)
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though (If I had a million dollars)
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm just fed up
That's my word (I could set my troubles free)

'97 Bonnie & Clyde,"[Intro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

[Verse 2]
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you scweamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee
There goes Mama, spashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride

Role Model,"[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

[Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me",The Slim Shady LP
My Fault,"[Chorus]
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

[Verse 1]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?""
""It's me and Kelly!""
""My bad"" (Sorry)
""Let's try another room""
""I don't trust you""
""Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods""
""Oh hell, I might as well try 'em, this party is so drab""
""Oh dag"" (Mmm)
""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag""
""Huh?""

""Yo, Sue""
""Get away from me, I don't know you""
""Oh shoot, she's trippin'""
""I need to go puke"" (Blehh)
""I wasn't tryna turn this into somethin' major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped ya
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out (Nah)""
She said, ""Help me, I think I'm havin' a seizure""
I said, ""I'm high too, bitch, quit grabbin' my T-shirt (Let go)
Would you calm down? You're startin' to scare me""
She said, ""I'm 26 years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook""
""(Hello) I'm over here, Sue (Hi)
You're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
'Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate""

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl (Whoops)
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (It's an accident)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

""Susan, wait, where you goin'? You better be careful""
""Leave me alone, dad, I'm sick of gettin' my hair pulled""
""I'm not your dad, quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors
'Fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back, just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave, he's the one who gave me these
(I'ma kill him)
John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you""
""He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude""
""Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?""
""Well, it depends on how many you had""
""I took three, she ate the other 22 caps
Now she's upstairs cryin' out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol""
""She's gonna die, dude""
""I know and it's my fault""
""Oh my God""

I never meant to bring you to my world (I'm sorry)
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault (What do I do?)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault

My God, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry

What up? What up? What up? (Outsiderz)
This is my dance song, can you hear me? (Outsiderz)
(Rah Digga, Young Zee, bust it, bust it)
Alright, ayy, turn my headphones up

[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red like the bloodshed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish kabab
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I can't stand white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (Um, one, two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', ""I suck"" (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""
I told 'em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
""It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here

You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stole, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
While I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, **** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

As the World Turns,"[Chorus]
(I don't know) Yes, man
(Why this world keeps turning) As the world turns
('Round and 'round) We all experience things in life
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
Trials and tribulations
(I don't know) That we all must go through
(Why this world keeps turning) When someone wants to test us
('Round and 'round) When someone tries our patience
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)

[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, ""It wasn't me, I got a twin""
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, ""Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed""
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) As the world turns
(Why this world keeps turning) These are the days of our lives
('Round and 'round) These are the things that we must go through
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Day by day

[Verse 2]
We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, ""What up? It's nice to meet ya"" (Hi)
""I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me""
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
""I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now""
She said, ""Come in, it's unlocked""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, ""Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, ""Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best""
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)

[Chorus]
('Cause I don't know) And as we go along
(Why this world keeps turning) Throughout the days of our lives
('Round and 'round)
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning

I’m Shady,"[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed ""Fuck the world""
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ahh, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin

Bad Meets Evil,"[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night, you can still hear
The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9""

[Verse 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (Uhh)
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead (Ohh)
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said (Yo)
Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity
Holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth

[Chorus: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
We hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either
Shit, me neither

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle (Ahh)
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up
And I'm pissed off, 'cause I can't find a decent vein
The disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
'Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains
While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees
Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me
From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough
To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt

[Interlude: Eminem]
Hello? (Billy?)
Ayo, what’s up? (We're comin' to get you)
Stop, they know it's us

[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Uh-uh)
I'm the one who burned your house down (Oh)
Well, I'm out now (Shit)
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" & Eminem]
'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell (Uh-huh)
Wall Street (Yup), Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady (Uh)
See you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (Until next time)

[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so, that's the story of when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin' out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on 'til this day
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?",The Slim Shady LP
Still Don’t Give a Fuck,"[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (""Here, Momma, try 'em on"")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass",The Slim Shady LP
Kill You,"[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy my momma used to
Tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized
She was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'Til the vocal cords won't work in her throat no more? (Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ahh)
Put your hands down, bitch—I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ahh)
Shut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut—okay, Ma?
""Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother
Abusin' a whore, snortin' coke and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""
You goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious
Vain Vicodin, *vrin vrin vrin!*
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me (I said)

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with
Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Ah, haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with
Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Bitch, I'ma kill you!)

[Verse 2]
Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows, and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ""acid rap,"" but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth (Ahh)
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me (I said)

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with
Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Ah, haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with
Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Haha)

[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink?!
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before-school or outta school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin'
Air in your lungs just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache!
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?!
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet! I said shut up
When I'm talkin' to you! You hear me? Answer me!

[Pre-Chorus]
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me, bitch, I'ma kill you!

[Chorus]
You don't wanna fuck with
Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with
Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you

[Intro: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you prob'ly hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

[Chorus: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

Who Knew,"[Intro]
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I)
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) Who woulda knew?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) Who woulda known?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) Fuck would of thought?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

[Verse 1]
I don't do Black music, I don't do white music (Nope)
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (Ah!) (Shit)
You probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the backseat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth? How?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around? (Look)
I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out (Oh my God! Oh my God!)
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while our president gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement (The kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, ""Go!"" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?! Ain't they got the same moms
And dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse (Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch and changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be if nineteen
Million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 3]
I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago, I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run-up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

Fuck it, just shut up and listen

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin', then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way, but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady,I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth gradethey've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters

I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say ""fuckin''' for six minutes
(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
(Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?)
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16s and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match

I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like Hell, shit, I'm anxious as Hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, 'cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*), ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed (Uh)
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"" (""Oh, oh, oh, oh!"")
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted
I'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from
That's why they call me—

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back) (Slim Shady!)

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a .9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time (Ahh-! Ahh-ahh-!)
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (*scratch*- Slim, I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (*scratch*- I'm back), I'm back (I'm- *scratch*- I'm back)  (Slim Shady!)
That's why they call me Slim Shady (*scratches* Slim, I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (*scratch* I'm back), I'm back

Marshall Mathers,"[Intro]
You know, I just don't get it
Last year, I was nobody
This year, I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around
Like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me
Ten-million dollars?
Get the fuck outta here

[Chorus 1]
You see, I'm just Marshall
Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the
Fuss about me (Fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did
Was doubt me (Did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to
Take shots at me (Take shots at me)

[Verse 1]
Yo
You might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin' (Ruff ruff)
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Rémy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block suck a lot of dick
Boy, girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it (Hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me (Uh-uh), he said some shit in Vibe to spite me (Yo)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (Haha)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer (Hehe)
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Aks 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (Ah!)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus""? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'm just Marshall
Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out
If you talk about me (Talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes
Doubt me (Assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot
At me (Best shot at me)

[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a three-sixty
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, **** ******** **** ******'* * faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins (Hey, it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help, uh, here
""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

[Chorus 3]
'Cause I'm just Marshall

I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the
Fuss about me (Fuss about me)

Take shots at me (Take shots at me)

Yeah, hahahaha
Whoo, shit
Mmm
Oh, oh, mmm
Ehh, ehh
Aight, guess what? I ain't comin' in yet
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh
I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

[Chorus: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we'd do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more

[Chorus: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)

‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mari-ju-ana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed

[Chorus: Eminem & Dina Rae]
‘Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no"" (No)
They won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)
These drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)

Thinkin' he won't, goddammit, he will
(He's) Mentally ill from Amityville

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat (Ah)
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin' up in the urinal
(You fuckin' homo) That's what I said at my dad's funeral

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still (Still)
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit, he gets killed (Killed)
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville (Ville)
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled (Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still (Still)
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill (Hill)
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot (Shoo)
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with 'em too (Too)
That's the mentality here (Here), that's the reality here (Here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen (Happen), when a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it; goddammit, he meant it when he told you

And start riots like Limp Bizkit (Limp Bizkit!)
Throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga!)

Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa! Not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit!)

Came a long way to makin' these songs play

Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust

What in the world gives me the right to say what I like
And walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)

Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out? That's fine""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him
He ain't so hot now, is he? Little punk

There's a **** year old little ****
Laying dead with a slit throat, in your living room
Haha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you? (No)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you
Oh my God, I love you How the fuck could you do this to me?
(I'm sorry) How the fuck could you do this to me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault
""Oh my God, I'm crackin' up"" Get a grip, Marshall
Hey, 'member the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat (No)
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We could've—, hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell
Here, I'll scream with you, ""Ah! Somebody help""
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

[Verse 1: Eminem & Swifty McVay]
Ha-ha, two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass, so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything, I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy, I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, “Forgive me”
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Chorus: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three-hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs, like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'–nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a ”Stop the Violence” rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers, until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple, until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you, and stab you
Get executed 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', “Kuniva, yo, yo!”
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Verse 6: Kon Artis & Eminem]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight, 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp (Uh!) for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis, since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say, ""I got cancer"", get dropped, take the advancement, and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? 'Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""

Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-

In place of the Doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as

Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day

Brian, don't throw that (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping block (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (You can ask)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut! (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Right on)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swole up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Eh?)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Outro]
Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)

White America,"[Intro]
(The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only, no parking)
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby, Ooh, baby! Look at my sales
Let's do the math: If I was Black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was White
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan Black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every White fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot,"" shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—

On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a ""hell...""? (Hell yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)

Cleanin' Out My Closet,"[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet",The Eminem Show

It feels so good to be back
La-l-ladies and gent-g-gentleman-gentleman-an
Introdu-du-ducing the new-new and improved-proved you-you know who-who (Chka-err, chk-err, chka)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Canibitch don't want no beef with Slim, no
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From séance to séance, aw-a-aw-a-a-aw-a-aw

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on now! Let's all get on down (Let's dance)
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time (Let's sing)
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout (Join hands)
Let your hair down and square dance with me (Be free)
Come on now! Let's all get on down! (Let's chill)

Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout (And dance)
Let your hair down and square dance with me! (With me)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back (Boo!)
The boogie monster of rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' they food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say, ""Hussein,"" you say, ""Shady""
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

Come on now! Let's all get on down! (Let's dance)
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time (Let's sing)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me, shoot at me! (Woo-hoo!)
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got a the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm Pac, on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny, I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y

Soldier,"[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (La-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier)
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier)
Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

Even if my collarbones crush or crumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]

These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up

Sayin', ""Goodbye"", sayin', ""Goodbye"" to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now—

Sayin', ""Goodbye"", sayin', ""Goodbye"" to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books 'cause I don't wanna look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol, I would
And end it for good, just say, “Goodbye” to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once
‘Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad, ‘cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had
Was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm

[Chorus]
Sayin', ""Goodbye"", sayin', ""Goodbye"" to Hollywood

Sayin', ""Goodbye"", sayin', ""Goodbye"" to Hollywood

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame in real life, this is sick
""Publicity stunt"" my ass, ""conceal"" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact, I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt, I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never would've rapped
I sold my soul to the Devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated

For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches (Bitch!) on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick (That bitch!)
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk (Damn!)
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable (Shit!)
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits (Damn!)
Sippin' on that fine shit, I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice (C'mere)
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
""Don't stop!""—response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger-lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner (Yeah)
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch (C'mere), the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next (Holy)
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? (Shit!) This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, 'cause my dick was unprotected (Damn!)
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)

Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
And you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us

Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Sing for the Moment,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)

'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too

I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (Yeah-yeah)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

First thing you say:
""I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me""
Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game
""Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great""
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

Hailie's Song,"[Intro]
Da-da-da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
Haha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit (Sit), starin' out the window ('Dow)
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think (Think), there's nothin' to live for (For)
I almost break down and cry, sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy! Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
(Fuck, I was scared)
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl (Girl), keeps gettin' older ('Der)
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes (Jokes) 'cause they don't understand me (Me)
They just don't see my real side, I act like shit don't faze me
Inside it drives me crazy, my insecurities could eat me alive

[Pre-Chorus]
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh no

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs
Bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore: Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And—

[Bridge]
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders (Thanks)
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Woo! Heh, told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what? Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​",The Eminem Show
When the Music Stops,"[Intro: Bizarre]
Music, reality: sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Lid to the can of whip-ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
""Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that""
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin' rid of McVay, if so, you would've tried
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
Got drunk then I finished him
I'm every nigga's favorite archenemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres (Bah)
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was happy havin' a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy
But it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dawg
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with their hands out
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, ""Damn!"" when you slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm 'bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call?
When the music stops

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
Your head just explode with red stuff
I'm handcuffed, tossed in the paddy-wagon
Braggin' about how you shouted like a coward
Bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war wit' your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife (Ah!)
Deliver that shit that coroners like
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night
When the music stops

[Verse 5: Proof]
Instigators turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark, my dogs all bark like, ""Woof!""
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe, shit, the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop

[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said ""Fuck tha Police,"" now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset, smokin' crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P. had me grimy and gritty
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin' in shock

Say What You Say,"[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Heh, so I'm out the game, huh? (Huh, huh)
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever (Ha-ha)
Well, I'm wit' ya, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
But what about Jermaine? Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over eighty million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
‘Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (Come on)

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre knows I'm aboutFast cars and Alizé, partyin' all day
But I handled my business, ‘cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
‘Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact and I'm gone, and I'm back
I speed write and my loose leaf's my launchpad
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head, you headed west?
Talk shit about Dre, you better get a vest and invest in something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend, I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source? Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' with, huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

Till I Collapse,"[Intro: Eminem]
(Yo, left, yo, left) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
(Yo, left, right, left) Feel weak, and when you feel weak
(Yo, left, yo, left) You feel like you wanna just give up
(Yo, left, right, left) But you gotta search within you
(Yo, left, yo, left) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(Yo, left, right, left) And get that motivation to not give up
(Yo, left, yo, left) And not be a quitter
(Yo, left, right, left) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg & Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall

My Dad's Gone Crazy,"[Intro: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Haha
Okay then! Everybody, listen up
I'm goin' to hell
Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him
I think my dad's gone crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahnn) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it)

[Chorus: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me: ""Rana rana rana ra-
-Na, rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'""
Uh, fuck that shit, bitch
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my MO
I wouldn't have to go eeny-meeny-miny-moe
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad)

[Chorus: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
With more pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Chorus: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy (Crazy)

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ayo, 50, what I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it, ha-ha

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do

If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up
Checkmate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Verse]
It doesn't take much for me to raise such a stank up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Is like smearin' bloodstains with a paintbrush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
I'm patiently waitin' for the day, I’m anxious
To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
You're drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must've just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talkin', motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit, wake up then make up?
Fuck that! It’s too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits
With the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaws to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So, I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I peel the paint off, I never been shot
But I think me and 50 must've been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain
When they tried to rush him and lost and came back
And gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holdin' my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list, it just ain’t Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back, I’ll be shootin' more than just paintballs
Trust me

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up

We As Americans,"[Intro]
There's an intruder
In my house
He cut my phone line (911, emer-)
Can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police
But I doubt
They're gonna hear me (*gun cock*)
When I shout
*gunshot*

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit foolin' with me
Quit foolin' with me, bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always
Gotta be an issue when you're me in which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs, I'm comin' with flare guns

[Chorus]
We as Americans, we as Americans
Us as a citizen gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means, we as Americans
Us as a citizen, we are Samaritans
What do we get us in? We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been, take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President *daed*
It's never been said, but I set precedents
In the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard,"" the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack, click (*gunshot*)

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my baby back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means

Love You More,"[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?
We say “We do it for our baby”, but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck, 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad, but it's true: when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do, 'cause—

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed, and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus, I can bust in that, and that's why—

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
“Someone else,” problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric in every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, what you do
I'mma hunt you down, 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
Does this remind you of flowers and the candy?
All the times that you threw it back at me
You told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

(I, I wanna grow up too)
""Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?""
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
""Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash.""
""Grab this silver paint and let's paint my ass.""
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the ""Mr
Not-Havin'-It,"" it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: ""Slim, you're really startin' to upset me.""
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre

Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 3]
So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
""Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!"" ""Let's Go!"" [whoosh]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
""What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri.""
""Fuck it,"" keep goin', no time to waste
""Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case.""
""Okay,"" fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
""Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!""
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
""He couldn't have fell off that hard."" Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
[Four impacts] ""What was that?"" ""Pet Shop Boys.""
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch and then stomped the bitch again
""Compton!"" ""Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!""
""Stomp him!"" ""Switch feet!"" ""Stomp him!"" ""Switch again!""
""Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!"" (""Ahh!"")
""Damn,"" ""He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!""

Bully,"[Intro]
Yo, check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
""I'm withholdi-in' my anger, though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist, that he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect""
That's what he says to himself, as he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
And he just can't see that he's maniacally depressed
And in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world, so he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins, 'til he hurls himself into a rage
And it's destroyin' him slowly, 'cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's actin' like a bully, so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string, and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff, and puff, and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks, so you ain't takin' out shit,
And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown,
So now you try to pull the race card, and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus the stylist you fucked, when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch,

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be takin' too much E

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excludin' myself, 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it, when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold, when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja, like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feedin' him pills, so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will, and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talkin' to you straight: if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap, I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvin, get your boy off of that E

6 in the Morning by D12,"[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning! Ha-ha!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Are y'all with us or what?
Well, come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, bitch!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin' my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get past these little piss ants
That wanna be brawny bad asses so bad
And they so mad, they can't stand it
'Cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap, and it's a wrap, and it's scrap, and then it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion is to smash anyone rappin' without havin' to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
'Cause I'm tellin' you right now, you're not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin' you with me
You poke a stick at a pit bull, you get bit, B
These words stick to you like Krazy Glue when you diss me
'Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets to 50
I'm the beautiful-lest thing and you gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Keith Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof, are you with me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words, and you can't sing along, then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody, good morning!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
They consider me the epitome me of a beef starter
In a party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs, I'm walkin' gloves with a shotgun
Constantly poppin' slugs, they hot, son, better not run (Aah!)
The bosses of all bosses; a holocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a gothic death project, you stop breathin'
You die quicker than Mach speed without bleedin'
It ain't about what you readin'
When you meet me, better speak like a season's greetings
Either that or we'll be beefin' frequent
You niggas need an ''E'' just to speak shit
Your leader's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it, and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave, you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words, and you can't sing along, then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody, good morning!

[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I heard you niggas don't like us, but so what?
This beef is like, ""What the fuck did he say in his rap, Em?""
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please, I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks and my MPC and a mic
They empty out on them bike to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say: ""Fuck you, bitch, and I don't like you!""
What?! I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
To leave D12 in this, but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon, fellas, get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, c'mon!

[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you seriously, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys, but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked 'cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust, you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach
And when they want it I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon, so get to gunnin' if you coming

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers, come on in
'Cause we get it on until the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
'Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words, and you can't sing along, then

We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin' you a murderer, and you spelt it wrong
You put E before the D because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (Bitch), you a replica guy
If he was still alive, you would never get by (For real)
All you do is cry, bitch, keep it real
Life is more than imitatin' niggas and eatin' pills (Ha)
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you? They didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover, ‘cause he need it
And all you niggas hatin', shut your mouths
It's just that real niggas ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out

So Murder Inc, do your thing, muhfuckas

Who expects nothin' less than R&B coming from that regime
""Regime"" is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billie Holiday–how it happen?
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him, ""Reenact him, you go platinum!""
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenactin' her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy, mash and destroy

Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not

Ja, quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

Now, we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious, nigga, you shook
You half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook, nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone, you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga, please stick to the script
Before the guns, stick to the clip

Fuckin' old-ass, ignorant, innocent-lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on: is it me, or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch-made man; now, how you gonna connect
With them short ass arms, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holler and curse
Go ahead, respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

[Verse 4: Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up, Gotti? And this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for Stuckey and Bush Stones
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggas?
Roll like a boss in the streets, they still feel us
It's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
You talking nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss, you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggas early and ain't scurred to bust

[Verse 5: Kon Artist]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster get jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac or that transvestite
That dress like a Lil Kim fox?
You're just like a little windbox
When I press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Now, swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love will help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryna mock Pac
You Mockaveli, get your own identity!

You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

And everyone should get along
Okay, children, quiet down, quiet down
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children, quiet down please
Brian, don't throw that (Shut up!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)
Good luck, Mr. Shady!

[Verse 1]
Hi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)
Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping block (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Come on)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (You can ask)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (That's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut! (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Right on)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swole up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Eh?)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you

[Chorus]
See, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)
And there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?

Come on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)
Sing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)
Come on, clap along
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)

My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess, but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really shoulda fell, but I stood, see, I came
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe, because

My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusin'
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See, I could sit and argue with you, but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
'Cause I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids’ll copy? Prob'ly millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then, 'cause

At a alarming rate, common denominate
Add it up, and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate, but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, ""Slim, you great!""
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cause, man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but

[Chorus]
I'm only entertainin' you, my
Goal is to stimulate, makin' you high
And take you and I
To a place that you can't see but I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just the man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you (Yeah)

Rabbit Run,"[Verse]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up, I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit

If I could just put it all into all I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it, instead of starin'
At this wall and shit while I sit, writer's block
Sick of all this shit, can't call it shit

All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic

I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this buildin' up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up

The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch

Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me

You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me's gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me

You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

It's just “Sometimes”, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper

I'm desperate at my desk
If I could just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin', nope
It's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out

I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want

I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit, until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boilin' point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed

An MCs worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me, and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone

By the way, they're runnin', you would swear, the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'

He said, he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest”

Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch

But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too s-stable (RIP!)
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And y'all got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, 'cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissue
And not to diss you but God I was sick of looking at you

Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home

Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?

Back to ruin rap and destroy the industry

And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn, it's all a plan devised by the Man, it's a conspiracy
Against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits or ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out

Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone (Come on)
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone (Exclusive)
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself (Yeah)
Say, ""What up?"", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail and livin' reckless
But if you go check my belt, you may see something else I use to protect myself (Yeah)
A vest, to stop a Ruger and deflect the shells (Green Lantern)
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line (Uh-huh)
But this motherfucker Ja must've lost his mind (Woo)
That X got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' that same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth (Uh-huh)
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride, dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable I just slap ya
Killin' you faster than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to (Woo; yeah)
So what's the deal? Where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, ""Ja, what up, dog?""
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men
We could've solved it then
I'm a grown man, dog, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherf***in' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
Look so ridiculous now, look so ridiculous now
Look so ridiculous now, make you look so ridiculous now
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

Remembering me, discover and see
All over the world, she's known as a girl
To those who are free, their minds shall be keep
Forgotten as the past, 'cause history will last

Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say

God is a girl, she's only a girl

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, there goes gravity
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo!

One shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My [faggot] father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just [fuckin'] wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest [shit] I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da [killed him, shit], I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus: Groove Coverage]
God is a girl, wherever you are
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, whatever you say
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, however you live
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?
God is a girl, she's only a girl
Do you believe it? Can you receive it?

[Verse 5: Eminem]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father, please, forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sang this song
Sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song
It went a little something like:
""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn""
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And, by the way, where's my dad?

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black; well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tuch mull bish
""What was me, there goes poor Marshall, again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion, and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it: that little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it""
Man, if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please, release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please, believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say ""I'm sorry""
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know, but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So, please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Chorus]
Father, please, forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Chorus]
I said, ""Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds""

There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me

That we finally meet in the same place to see,

Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge: Eminem]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like, ""White boys don't know how to rhyme.""
I spit out a line and rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place""
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
""Exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!""
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
""You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!""
All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the ""Ole Foolish Pride"" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Like Toy Soldiers,"[Intro]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down

[Chorus: Martika]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never s'posed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm s'posed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm s'posed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly, I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me, ""Stay out,"" this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause

[Chorus: Martika]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ball game, you callin' names, and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him, mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.​
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, 'cause

[Chorus: Martika]
Step by step, heart to heart

Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as ""I'ma whip someone's ass""
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, they tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong

We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard

There I go, thinking of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

[Chorus]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead, slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

[Chorus]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do

Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable

Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him

Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve

Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry

Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, ""Ni—""
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the

Find out it was Justin sayin', ""I'm gon—nuh cum!""

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive, hence, if
I should draw the line any fences, if so, to what extents, if
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those 25-cent stickers on my refri-gerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super—

That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

Now in the Bible, it says:
""Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
'Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?""
Let's ask Dr. Dre—Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question, if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But up, I ain't done yet
In football, the quarterback yells out, ""Hut-hut""
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
It was never meant—it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—
His teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses

And my plan is to get him next and
Open up a whoop-ass canister
God damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic—yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom, I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit

But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
""Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?"" You, sir, are on truth serum
""Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities""

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Just Lose It,"[Intro]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand-new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand-new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there, someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Ass Like That,"[Intro]
Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that

Spend Some Time,"[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—

[Chorus: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Chorus: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!""
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

[Chorus: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine",Encore
Mockingbird,"[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Outro]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)",Encore
Crazy in Love,"[Intro: Heart]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say, ""love is blind""
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Chorus: Heart]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Chorus: Heart]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh",Encore
One Shot 2 Shot,"[Intro: Fatt Father]

What now, nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects, nigga

[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga, what about yo' wife?) Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
*Shot* That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva & Eminem]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping (Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere, and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing, and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield, and
She got hit, and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back, and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late!

[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 3: Swifty & Kon Artis]
(I been trying to call you all day, motherfucker, where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile *Shots* what the fuck was that? *Shots*
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat, nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with!)
Man! (I swear!) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three-thousand and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank, God, I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah, I guess not, what the fuck? Oh, my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So, one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off",Encore

Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back (Oh)
Too bad you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whining and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta' promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second (Bump, bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom, if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap, may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre to
Pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That's why we came to

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty of money involved
And plenty honey's involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
Let's rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speakers
So never say never, 'cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that, uh

We As Americans,"[Intro]
There's an intruder
In my house
He cut my phone line (911, emer-)
Can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police
But I doubt
They're gonna hear me (*gun cock*)
When I shout
*gunshot*

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit foolin' with me
Quit foolin' with me, bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always
Gotta be an issue when you're me in which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs, I'm comin' with flare guns

[Chorus]
We as Americans, we as Americans
Us as a citizen gotta protect ourselves
Look at how shit has been, we better check ourselves
Livin' up in these streets through worse and through better health
Survivin' by any means, we as Americans
Us as a citizen, we are Samaritans
What do we get us in? We better check ourselves
Look at how shit has been, take a look where you live
This is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President *daed*
It's never been said, but I set precedents
In the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard,"" the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack, click (*gunshot*)

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my baby back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans",Encore
Love You More,"[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?
We say “We do it for our baby”, but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck, 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad, but it's true: when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do, 'cause—

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed, and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus, I can bust in that, and that's why—

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
“Someone else,” problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric in every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, what you do
I'mma hunt you down, 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
Does this remind you of flowers and the candy?
All the times that you threw it back at me
You told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more",Encore
Ricky Ticky Toc,"[Intro]
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand ""How to Rob"" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering ""Fuck Compton""
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit

Demon Inside,"[Intro]
Uh-huh

Yo, alright, yo

[Verse]
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves, curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
""Come follow me into the gates of Hell""
I heard 'em yell, ""Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel""
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners",Singles

Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks (Ugh)
Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two Rotts
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
I used to sell pizzas, now I got twelve Visas
So tell Jesus that I'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes

That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter

Yo, I used to be too heavy in that cruisin' Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
I go to parties bumpin' Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted (What!)
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, ""Fuck ICP, buy my CD!"" (Yeah)
Is what I'm screamin' while I'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut (Ugh)
Tellin' bitches, ""Let me eat your pussy while I shave you!""
Ain't no shame in my game (Uh-uh), I turn the party out
Makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

Hi!

[Verse 1]
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check to smell it
Eminem starts with E, better check the spellin'
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple (Hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said ""I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to a furnace in Hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns (Pssss! Ow!)
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (Yuck!)
Hit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it
‘Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it

A brainiac, with a cranium packed
Full of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spasmatic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Lookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians (Uh)
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pens
I hope God forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends

[Chorus]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – listen!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

[Verse 3]
Last night, I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say
I call in at work, ‘cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls 'til I shredded skin
""Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!"" ""It's probably AIDS!"" ""Forget it then.""
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
""Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.""
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it (damn!)

[Chorus]
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – you hear me? Huh?
Is fuckin' crazy – hello?!
‘Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin' crazy – do you hear me?
Is fuckin' crazy

[Outro]
Hi, something's not right
I'm sorry, I'm mentally retarded
Slim Shady, I think that's my name
Rawkus Records, fuckin' crazy
Do you hear us? We're fuckin' crazy!
All of us! Hi… bye… goodnight, somethin'",Singles
Bad Influence,"[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!)

[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world (Right here), and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill, human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people'll feel me
'Cause I'ma still be The Mad Rapper whether I got money or not (Yep)
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get
One mic in The Source and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off: even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it

I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it (C'mon)
I laugh at the sight of death, as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Chorus]
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!

They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)

(Just do it!)

[Verse 3]
My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
So bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that ""Just the Two of Us"" would make you hate me this much
And ""Just the Two of Us,"" that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)

Our House,"[Intro: Eminem]
Here's the story
Of a little boy
Growin' up in a suburban home
Tryna cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house
That was built in the middle of the street [?]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
""Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the jukebox""
""So what, he shot two cops and raped a little girl while two dudes watched""
""Nuh-uh! They were tryna frame him""
""You and that Tupack Shaker...""
""No! That ain't how you say his name, Mom!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?""
""Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,""
""Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' Walkman at?""
""Stop cussin' at me!"" ""Shut up, bitch!"" ""And quit talkin' Black!""
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry, is Mom cookin' dinner?
""Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Tupack Shaker, I just asked him""
I'm freezin', (Achoo) I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
""I ain't did nothin', I didn't say 'I'm leavin'""
I said ""I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'"" (*snipping sounds*)
""Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,""
""Fine, I'll leave— Mom, you cut off the sleeves!""

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My teacher's two-faced, he went to lower all my school grades [?]
Since last Tuesday I had a toothache from Kool-Aid
So Mom kicked me out (Get out), and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool
'Cause I could go to Fred's, crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home in my own room alone
Beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle 'til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say ""I don't know where it is""
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her ""Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay""
Please, Mom, please, Mom, please, I wanna stay
(Let me stay)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My brother's incoherent, Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me like I'm transparent
Made it clear that I was just there to run her errands
Told her friends that I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
""Please, sell my stepson some cigarettes so I can smoke""
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Backfired, Mom sent me to school with a vengeance
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers get laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs, I can't rap
And I'm stupid, I'll never make it averaging a D+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poisonin' from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from Ball Park
""Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"" ""I don't think so
Now keep an eye on your brother, I'm goin' to bingo.""
""But, Mom, you said you were broke."" ""Who said?
You got your ears messed up from that damn rap music.""

I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em
I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em

No you pick 'em up! Bitch, stick 'em up

Yo (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na)
I dedicate this to you (Hahahaha, yo)
To all my fans: keepin' y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself!
'Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and
Which I create, 'cause that's my mission
So listen close to what we say, because
This type of fag claims to never be gay

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I knew you was jealous from the day, that I met you!
I upset you 'cause I get respect, I bet you! (What?!)
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew! (C'mon!)
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you (Aw)
Peckerwood mad, 'cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, ""Heck, country-western rap records are good""
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both (Haha)
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin' to hear some fuckin' old fart in a chair
Sittin' on stage, strummin' acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jumpstart your career?
I punch you in your fuckin' chest, 'til your heart kicks in gear! (Bitch)
And fuck your underground buddies' nameless crew
Like I'ma say they names, so they can be famous too

[Chorus 1: Eminem]
You just a quitter and you bitter, 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you, I'ma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter, 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you, I swear to God, I'ma kill you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke!
And I'ma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you! in a lobby! and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you?! Bitch, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck! come over to you
You better shut your fuckin' mouth while you O-for-two
Back in '94, Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck 'cause now your music sucks dick
Mr.-Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap quicker
But never last, and Everlast is a

Quitter and you bitter, 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you, I'ma kill you
You just a quitter and you bitter, 'cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'ma kill you, I swear to God, I'ma kill you (A'ight, look, listen)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So this is what we ask of our fans:
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass!
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp!
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid!
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it!
He's a bitch! He ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin'
Shit, in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin' tables in that bitch, cleanin' the toilets

Ayo, fuck this, cut this shit off
Ayo, Head (Hold up a minute)

First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay!
You claim to be a Muslim, but you Irish White
So fuck you, fat boy! Drop the mic, let's fight!
Plus, I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin' while you runnin' out of breath
Steady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CDs nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MCs
You ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight, haha!
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know

Yo, get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo

Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin' his ass floored for talkin' back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaurant, while I'm servin' ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart, 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch

Ha, ha, now we got the whole industry makin' fun of you, Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? It's only one of you, Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go around

This ain't no freestyle battle, Everlast gettin' killed with his chest open
Tryna throw a fuckin' punch, but you just chokin'
Havin' a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime!
'Cause you suck, motherfucker, you should learn to rhyme!
Talkin' about you packin' pistols, but it's funny to me!
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me!
I'm a paleface killer whale!
On his way to fuckin' prison, pistol whippin' tail
Ha, Erik, remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?!
That shit was obvious, you pro'bly was gay, ha

49 thousand copies the week your shit drop!
While my sales makin' records break!
Two and a half million scanned by the second week!

What the fuck, is you stupid?! I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin' guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With 16 parts, I stomped on his heart

Keep your restaurant locked and block your door
'Cause we hit 'em up, like motherfuckin' Tupac Shakur!

Patagonia sweatshirt and wine in a solo cup

I remember Eminem playing on the stereo
For early October, it was kind of cold
And neither one of us watching the football game
We had our first kiss that night
Back before time could fly

[Chorus]
We were runaway flames in a backseat fire
Growing up fast on renegade tires
Didn't worry about tomorrow
And it sure didn’t worry about us
Every time I kiss you it feels the samе
I still remember us that way
Oh, don't it feel just likе yesterday
You drove that old jeep and I still smoked

[Verse 2]
Now I wonder how many miles and Marlboros I burned up with that top down
I wonder how many suns we watched set and then come back up
And I wonder how many times your mama said, we'd never make it
And don’t give him your heart, girl, 'cause he's gonna break it
Now I really can't blame her, looking back on us

Because we were runaway flames in a backseat fire
Growing up fast on renegade tires
Didn't worry about tomorrow
It sure didn't worry about us
Every time I kiss you it feels the same
I still remember us that way
Oh and don't it feel just like yesterday
You drove that old jeep and I still smoked
Oh, I still smoked

To the runaway flames in a backseat fire
Growing up fast on renegade tires
Didn't worry about tomorrow

Gonna make it, can't give up now

Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land

Time for me to just take matters into my own hands

Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back

Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone

Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own

Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But, yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire (Here we go now)

[Verse 1: Eminem, Tony Yayo & DJ Green Lantern]
Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone (Come on)
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone (Exclusive)
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself (Yeah)
Say, ""What up?"", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail and livin' reckless
But if you go check my belt, you may see something else I use to protect myself (Yeah)
A vest, to stop a Ruger and deflect the shells (Green Lantern)
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line (Uh-huh)
But this motherfucker Ja must've lost his mind (Woo)
That X got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' that same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth (Uh-huh)
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride, dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable I just slap ya
Killin' you faster than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to (Woo; yeah)
So what's the deal? Where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, ""Ja, what up, dog?""
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men
We could've solved it then
I'm a grown man, dog, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on

[Chorus: 50 Cent, Eminem, 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk, but soon we gon' see

You don't wanna bump heads with me (Tony)

You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you (What?)
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buyin' a new pistol (Woo)
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six through your hats, a seven and 3/8s (Come on)
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you Shook Knight
I'll put my knife in your windpipe and breeze on the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times, so your ass a lame (Lame)
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal (Steven Segal, bitch!) (Come on)

You know you don't want it with me
You can talk, but soon we gon' see

I'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out the van, and (Break it, break it, break it down, uh)
They see me pop up more icy, 'cause I could (What?)
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood, good (Haha)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us and half of your artists got makeup on?
Every magazine I open, you on your knees takin' prayer pictures (Yeah)
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nuttin' 'bout what pain is, sucker

I got a friend of mine, named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now, the deal is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's go get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a goldmine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia, I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out, but I
Know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with the nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!)

You 'bout to play with his paper, you gonna fuck up his cheddar
Now homie think we gon' sweat 'em, but we just gon' forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll dead'em, let Yayo stomp his head in
It's all good 'cause we'd rather rap then to let a pussy play us
Out of pocket homie, so tell 'em, he better be easy
Start some bullshit, he'll get his whole crew wet

But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (Nope)

Please don't, you'll probably fall with me and our asses'll both be history (Aah!)
But then again, you'd finally get your wish
‘Cause you'd be all over the street like 50 Cent (Hahahaha)
You fuckin' punk, pussy, fuck you, chump
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up,
Tryna jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you—we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me
Bitch, I got two cases and probation—fight me
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists, right in
Front of the only thing that you have in this world, a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you're the only white boy up in that bitch, just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about bein' bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white (Haha)
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head—go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‘Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke!
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap (Haha)
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch, ain't it?
Raymond? Here, let me break this shit down in layman's terms for you
Just to make sure that you can understand us
And Canibus ain't usin' too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, and let me slow it down for you
So that you can understand if I say it slower
Let it go, dog, it's over

I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (Uh-uh)

Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get passed, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, ‘cause you last
And you might whoop some ass; if you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in
The Source was like our only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin', a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas
Or Benzino—shit, I don't even think you realize
You're playin' with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably ‘cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin' breath to get a five
Shit, I was right, I'da fuckin' died already tryin'
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet it's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too

Every issue there's an eight-page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid, you're just a fuckin' waste of lead
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This O.G's 'bout to get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin' mother
You motherfuckin' punk!
Put me on your fuckin' cover just to sell your little sell-out mag
I ain't mad, I feel bad, here's an ad
Here's a poster of Ray Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit
That you don't know about, yeah?
Let's talk about how you're puttin' your own son out there
To try to eat off him 'cause you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy, you're bored now
I'm pushin' 30, you're kickin' 40's door down
Bitch, this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me on your TV
‘Cause you've got to stay up 'til three in the mornin'
To see your video played once on BET
So, hee-hee, hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yeah
So, on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzino's wack; no matter how many times I say his name, he'll never blow, jack
You're better off tryin' to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion, and Ray owns a portion
So, half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin' and bossin' Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him, and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, ‘cause I would have never said shit if you'd

You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate tryin' to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is drivin' you crazy, you wonderin' how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now?
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefin' with you

When blacks and whites take different sides

We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother
And you are my sister, just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back till next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money 'cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'ma say, ""Look, honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass""
I said that before
But that's okay because, like I said, you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once, you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny, so I'ma say, ""Look, honey""
I've already said that before
But like I said again, you're nothing but a big whore
So when Mike catch on the bass line
That's okay 'cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point, black girls are bitches
That's why I'ma tell you, you better pull up your britches
'Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean, that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a god damn spanking
From me, the funky M&M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say, ""swallowing phlegm"" and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed, that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
'Cause— I forgot the chorus
But that's okay 'cause y'all saying, ""Bust a rhyme for us""
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you've got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go? I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say, ""Ole foolish pride""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Ole foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide",Singles
Fattest Skinny Kid Alive,"[Intro]
To the Batmobile, let's go
Yo, Manix man, I'ma take this one kinda slow, alright?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Welcome to the flipside
Hope he can swim, 'cause if he can't, he gonna drown in a riptide
It's pourin', plus the old man ain't snoring
'Cause you gotta get up pretty damn early in the morning
'Cause I'm slammin' like Basketball Jones
Slippin' out chrome for messin' with the break bones
You suckers disgust me like low fat
Gimme a bat and I'll show you where your head's at
Tryna hit the row when you paddles, you little Bocce
I think you better stay home and eat your broccoli
'Cause you still got a long ways to go
So you better step off, 'cause you picked the wrong Joe
You ain't ready to throw with the mighty man
And don't forget about the rest of the band
So you better get used to the shrine
'Cause I'll be rappin' as long as I can write rhymes
These rhymes are hand-craft like pottery
To make you see so many stars, you'd think you studyin' astrology
You wanted to live so tell about what you went through
You couldn't cut the mustard if I gave you a Ginsu

[Scratching]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quickly, step to the side 'cause I'm coming through
And do so much flippin', they call me W&W
So how could you think you outdid me?
While I'm still gettin' rid of waste quicker than a kidney
Steppin' to a rabbit is stupid when you're a turtle
Did you know you couldn't even blow a rhyme in a circle
Little kiddies are getting a bit too frolicky
Throwing me rhymes more sorry than an apology
Test me to talking you right up please
Let me give it the proper operation that it needs
So allow me to put a end to weak melody
Need it for suckers like peanut butter and celery
Friends in the zone with the words that I kick with ease
And leave with the face black feelin' like a Pekinese
And light up your set like Cheers
My mouth more tooth than a sharp pair of shears
And given that, I could love to chop to it
You remember the day you rhymes with the fools
Then you'll know what it's like to take a nosedive
Beat by the fattest skinny kid alive!

[Break: Eminem]
A'ight, we're gonna break it down for a second, and I'ma catch my breath
And I'ma let Butteh Fingiz go off on a scratch for a minute
Dude, Butteh Fingiz, when I give you the cue; come up with that funky-ass-diculous-dope scratch
Go for it

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, let me show you how the big boys play
Thinking 'bout us bustin' out into the fat girl on a Wednesday
While I grab the steel and put you through an ordeal
So kneel before me or fear who's more real
I'll make the best rhyme, look up there's a plaque
Start flowin' so much, I'll be in need of a maxi pad
It went so fast, my pen'll yell at me
Did so many drugs, my song will be a felony
How'd he ever get the nerve to confront me?
Well shit, that's what you get for being clumsy
Get more steppin' up, figure the competition
I got more jerks in my basement than you have twitches
Must you all get played out like Batman
Warped like Pager, crushed by the Fatman
And I takeover like a gossip
Blowin' 'em out so fast, I swear their name was proportion
Smooth as whipped cream but rough as a callous
So I'ma losing it, call me Mr. Malice
With a soul intent for destruction
One more hit for the Downstairs Productions

Steppin’ On To The Scene,"[Verse 1]
Eat 'em
Every time I come back, I’m putting the mask on my head
Beat the sons of a bitches so hard that they forget where they’re at
I ain’t saying the same thing every time I attack
Damn, I just got whooped by a new jack
A New Jack, may be new, let me jack this
[Design?] a few [?] the fact
Of an experience lack
I just ignore 'em
Take my energy and store it
Who want decided to get brave
Then I pour it, pour it
On his ass
Like milk over a wilted plant
Constantly tromping in and around
To get paid again
I drink beer
So, you better steer clear
’Cause I steer and smear
The crip who interferes
Ripping a bastard up in less than a minute
Let’s get hunked by a truck
Suck a straw with answers in it
Suckers are dropping in the back that I stood
I can rhyme while I’m puking and it would still sound good
Even when out of gas
I’m pulling rhymes from my ass
You won't be think as fast enough to talk through the glass
Rain rhymes, you performed a song that you regret
While my money is due, so I can let through the exit
And let's get hangin' at [zen?]
Part of me’s so bad
’Cause I prefer to leave a blur
When I stirred your ass

Don’t Chew With Your Mouth Full,"[Verse 1]
Livin' like a truant, but fluent with ingenuity
Takin' our spaces, the racist leavin' a vacuity
So now I'm [procured?] original, sooner said than done
Drimmin' then better done, to stun the bald headed one
Blind to astonish, I admonish got the trigger, this finger with emotion that's pent up in it
But now, [I'ma dent'm?]
Try and combine a short wick with a quick temper
You're closer to death in the dark with distemper
You trapped no vagile, fragile as a thin branch
You got a better script, better rip or get avalanched
I'm stepping up the fore on my thumb to expand my fist
Quicker than expected, perfected
Delaying with this so clear me a path
And knock you out while doing it
You open your mouth so damn much, your own foot flew in it
You a man or a midget, you should call yourself [Gidgetski?]
The way you be blowing the mic and throwing your shit at me
Old and crusty, dusty as chalk
I should put your ears to your mouth and make you listen to yourself talk
Have you heard you yet? Obviously not
Otherwise you'd realize what a fag you sound like and stop

[Chorus]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
'Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 2]
9-2-3 dash 3-6-9-4, ding-dong, wrong number
Now what you wanna die for?
One man only
Put your right in, it took two
I'm shooting like a freelance and dancin' all over you
Yeah, you bet you I'ma catch you sooner or later I'll find you
Track you down, smack you down, blind you
The heat's dealt, so you're melted before you even felt it
Welted from being belted
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
[Earth?] slackin', I'm throwin' pitches and switches
Which is trickery, victory's repetitious
The weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

[Chorus]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
'Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 3]
With the mentality of a gerbil
You, brother, you said you're sad
Your lips are becoming chapped
From suckin' so damn bad
Your fear is a big downpour, as I begin a bright star
And when it takes off in my path
Question, should I break your face and take your place
Sorta transfer the answer, undoubtedly yes
Blockin' your [leadin' crown?], and knockin' you back a mile
You'd swear we were twins, if I'd been over and cracked a smile
I'm going at 'em and splat 'em
Trip 'em and laugh, rip 'em in half
No regroupin', you're troopin'
While I'm stoopin', yet the beams from your forehead
Still shines like a flashlight
Then I'm gonna turn you out, burn you out!
You face defeat
Beat down by brains
I grab your jugular vein to double the pain
You struggle and strain, but it's useless
Collapsed in a lost fight
So hot you smolder, but colder than frostbite

[Verse 4]
You take out crews by yourself, take out this one
I'm a soloist, Chaos is a soloist pick one
Either of us'll put mud tracks in your skull
And put your crew in a pile and stack 'em up like a totem pole
I give you a chance to make a change of direction
Or have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when you're trailing
Your smooth sailing hit a storm, it looks likes your failing
Left a band that's stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded
I'm standing colossal, rag you out like a fossil
With a rap so hot it will cause a snot in your nostril
Take you out, take you out with simplicity
I'm shocking so bad, I'll make you shit electricity
Try and flip me or whip me you fucking sped
Bon appetite, eat the concrete, dickhead

[Chorus]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
'Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

Ah, foolish one, do not step to one to whom you cannot step to!

Unreallistically Graphic,"[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've got divas sleeping at my house like a lodge
Cause after one massage, I hit them with a barrage of flesh they can't dodge
My garage and driveway are filled with parked cars to the street from visitors who didn't survive me
One night stand of loosey-coochie, dying in my animal house with my neighbors like John Belushi
I talk dirty to nuns until they're horny as Satan, and keep them running back there like Walter Payton
Here ya go, here's my number yo, dial M&M for Murder if you wanna undergo
A hard day's night and we can get on it
I pack a full load, and I do ya like laundry
Cause I believe that all bad girls must get spanked
So come gank the clank, and we'll go clackety-clank
And you'll be permanently added to my collection
So I suggest you feed the dogs in front of the lawn before ya check in

[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
See, I may be a youngster but baby I can do the pullup for ya
Physically delirious so get your butt over
Cause like Whitney I've been saving all my love for you
So roll out the the great taste of Pepsi, and get ready for Mountain Dew!
Here's a [?] cause looks can be deceiving
If you look into my eyes you'll be perceiving a sexual demon
And don't measure me in just 12 inches, since it's essential to make you suffer a bit, [?]
So let's put our heads together, we'll come up with something
Jimmy Deans are like raw cut, you're cookin', so
Grab the meat, at a place that's dirt cheap [?] for such a delicacy
You'll be royalty to me if there's loyalty to me baby
Yeah maybe I get this sweaty and salty [?]
We'll get in that heavy-duty bucket
I ain't using protection, I ain't Vanilla Ice, I want the satisfaction!

[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All I'm asking for is one night
And in the heat of the moment, your pants dropped and I do my best work at night
So after seven I can't stop, once I kiss you you'll be wanting me really bad
And how you feel [?] without the natural aphrodisiac
I'll getcha hot [?] rap
[?] getcha hot [?] graduate [?]
[?]
[?] flooded with anxiety
Shouted, ""Oh have mercey"" like, ""Yeah, put it inside of me!""
And once I begin to dig and make that hole twice as big you can't renege
I've got nymphos to where they can't stand sex
Cause I've ended up stretching their muscles like Spandex
Watch 'em squirm like a worm the entire term
Get a firm grip, aim for the eye and shoot sperm!
And all the action got the capability for excitement
But the night ain't done yet, 'till we reach enlightenment
So, yo... do you think you can handle it?

[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine",Soul Intent

You got your bars on repeat and you call that a skill?
You preach on Kontrol beat trynna be Kendrick on this shit
Still your rhyme skill's weak
You still need to grow feet, cuz this circus you trynna run's pharaonic
Twas daal writing your name lyrically Kal, cuz we both know you weak
True definition to your naam Lyrically Mess-IAH
This record a quick sweep
For dirt like ya, you know your act was derp, cuz you know you can't keep up with I
Is you outta your mind?
I can tell from your view that Khusco murdered I, when I got him to rewriting his verse
The picture is now clear that I'm too complex for your ass
And damn right, the track is mine drama queen
I'm only entertained by scary movies like eminem and 5'9""
And if you gon' talk your ass nice on the mic
Probly you should name your single hit without my ass on the line
Lyrically I'm underated
You said, I should stick to beats, you give me that, double complimentary
Your ass on respect mode, still you mouth to test your skill, talking about skill, hell sending you alphabetically
Look, I Ace with beats
See, I'm a rap Dea and you's a lunesta
There's power in my rap's like the Ee
F was you thinking G?
Like Junkie without H, I put L+L on this verse like Cool J
Dropping your K, rising your HBP
Juss this L enough to leave you with Cancer
Dawn of the sun, guess who's playing Eminem at 3AM aNd you ain't got no place to conceal
Oh!!! Perhaps you do, say peace to rap, find yourself cuz you don't belong here
Six different paths heading the same direction
Here's a cue to your ass
Hope you Are ready for hell
I'm skipping the S, cuz there's no peace in this verse(I ain't no buddhist)
I do double me, cuz it's still T on this beat
You juss a V shape between a woman's legs boy
P.O.W I'mma fuck you up

To tell the truth I think beating it is easy
Came to shitty deals reminiscing give me chills
From Dakota to the corna get that bakin' soda KILLA
Why run against a thoroughbred when you ain't in no condition
Buy rare art antique pieces Mona Lisas
In to the fitness tryna get into the business

Turn the lights on and the bugs don't run
And I don't love no one
Got the rap game sewn up sho-nuff
I tell the truth so I guess I keep it real now Uh
C'mon now they done.. they know I do it
I do me no I do three
Is it because I got the chicks feelin my music
If you seen holding new green in my blue jeans

Most of it comin straight out the pulpit
Wake up and call out the culprit
And to tell you the truth I feel like I be out here for the fun of it
And for the right amount of money

Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
She the ring leader in a clique of birds
The kids was just starin at each other

Letter of remember from my fan came now I was a head case
I'm plainly sayin what I'm sayin to make these haters mad
While slaves defy water start roofing paper bags
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
I can tell that your love muscle got a real nice strong grip
From the porches to the Porsches with the wides on it
Now the people got the light on me
Five hundred with the Grammy but not the one that i wanted
[Verse 9: Cece Spin Da Block]
This origami dream is beautiful pull the tail watch the wings
Stay truthful to me and never lie to me
Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be
Like it?s back when we was lil and it?s still time to kill
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Tell every last one of ya girls how good it was and its gone be onn
My Clan in the joint man we got it locked
[Verse 10: Dede The King]
While she climbs up and down
No down and no out just up and about
I'm urgin to put the Glock up and clap rounds
To tell the truth it excites me I scream it out
I had to kill Whitey word to the almighty
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Cold-hearted leaves fall off the tree on my Timbs
And the freaks wouldn't speak I never had lipstick on my cheek",D12

I been okay, off of shit, brain luck

[Verse]
I'm choppin' you up into pieces
Tell me, dude, why you still breathing?
Stain in his body get leakin'
Paranoid, I can't escape
I'm draggin' his body parts down to the lake
Give up what you say
Your skull get curb-stomped
Talkin' that shit, but he built like a bullfrog
Bitch, don't bend, uh, uh
They acting like some fans, uh, uh
Sack bigger than Santa, uh
I pray the death upon you, fuckhead
I'm pissed off, I see red
I pray the death upon you, fuckhead
I'm on the road, get head
You a filthy enеmy, you runnin' up you history

[Chorus]
Cannot stand other human fucks
I take my life, only way outta hеre
I been okay, off of shit, brain luck
I'm chasing six shots with shit-grade beer
Cannot stand other human fucks
I been okay, off of shit, brain luck",D12
"Murder, Murder","[Chorus: 2Pac, Swifty McVay & Masta Ace]
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
This shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad, I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate, and we can operate to save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack (AHHHHHHH!)
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til the vertebrae broke
Just then, the pigs bust in yellin', ""Freeze!""
But I'm already wanted for sellin' ki's
And a bunch of other felonies from A-to-Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

[Chorus: 2Pac, Swifty McVay & Masta Ace]
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back-end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face — ""Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!""
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, ""Fuck it! Mug her while you're there,"" jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off, kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', ""Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbin' all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must've been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and must've dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', ""Truce-truce!"" (Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Chorus: 2Pac, Swifty McVay & Masta Ace]
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill
All I see is murder, murder, my mi-, my, my, my mi-, my, my, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate
All I see is murder, murder, my mindstate (Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill)

If I Had,"[Intro]
""Life,"" by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it
It's gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground (If I had a million)
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies with secret identities
In disguises to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny, money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearin' that they was always down
What is life? I'm tired of life

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
Tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square, tired of not bein' a millionaire

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics (If I had a million dollars)
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john (I could set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke, and always poor
Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store
Tired of not havin' a phone
Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not drivin' a BM
Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him
Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum
Tired of not bein' on tour
Tired of fuckin' the same blonde whore after work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones
Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', ""Where hip-hop lives"" (Where hip-hop lives)

[Chorus]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics (If I had a million dollars)
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john (I would set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit (If I had a million dollars)
Tellin' me to be positive, how am I 'posed to be positive
When I don't see shit positive? You know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see (If I had a million dollars)
You know what I'm sayin'? Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city (You could share my wealth with me)
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But hey, it's cool though (If I had a million dollars)
You know what I'm sayin'? I'm just fed up
That's my word (I could set my troubles free)
(If I had a million dollars)",Slim Shady EP
"Low Down, Dirty","[Chorus: Redman, The Notorious B.i.G. & Eminem]
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty! (Ahh)
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Warnin', this shit's gon' be rated R: restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my mama, ""Bitch, you got a sick kid""
Arrested, molested myself, and got convicted
Wearin' visors, sunglasses, and disguises
'Cause my split personality is havin' an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearin' voices in my head while these whispers echo
""Murder-murder, redrum!"", brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
""How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?""
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (Rah!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler (Ah! Ah!)
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring yo bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

[Chorus: Redman, The Notorious B.i.G. & Eminem]
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch of crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doin' whippets, passed out like sampler snippets (Hi)
Where's the weed? I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine, so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke and left rich
Walking biohazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check, bitch!
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast (The fuck is this?)
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips (Pew)
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence (Hahahaha)
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

[Chorus: Redman, The Notorious B.i.G. & Eminem]
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider-Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Ah-de-la, ah-de-la)
Delinquent, chokin' microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like, ""Ooh, this is good! Who sings this?""
""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"" (Drug shit)
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, livin' on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishin'
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying; God, is that you? (God, is that you?)
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip-hop
They say that's where it lives, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks (Pssh)
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

[Chorus: Redman, The Notorious B.i.G. & Eminem]
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!
I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed!
Low down dirty, even, I'm low down and I'm shifty! (Ahh)
And if you hear a man that sounds like me, smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from!

Just the Two of Us,"[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (No!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

[Verse 2]
There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free — whee!
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

[Outro]
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be there for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby",Slim Shady EP
No One’s Iller,"[Intro: Bizarre, Eminem]

Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha-ha
No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me (No one)
No one is iller than me (Nobody)
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay, Bizarre, Eminem]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake (Fake)
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well (You might as well)
Be within a twenty-five to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now (Ow)
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how? (How?)
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – blaow! (Blaow!)
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, ""No one is iller than me,"" uhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
‘Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TV's and VCR's is at
I done lost a hundred pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at daycare centers and yell: ""Everybody get out!""
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair with her ten-year-old niece

[Chorus: Bizarre & Eminem]
No one, no one's iller than me (No one)
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me (Nobody)
(My name's Slim Shady)
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem, Bizarre]
Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy (Uh-huh)
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly (I'm fresh)
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends, who gives a fuck who they was? (Who they was?)
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does (What?)
They probably don't be packin' anyways— do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid (Ugh!)
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted (Blasted)
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic (Plastic)
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters (Master)
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota, Bizarre]
I run shit like an ass with legs (What?)
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead (What?)
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs (Ugh!)
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads (Threads), flashin' bread
Roll down the window: ""Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!"" (Legs)
You can get 'til that ass get red (Uh)
You can get 'til that ass get red (Uh, take it)
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers (Writers)
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters (What fight?)
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick (Stick)
Some bitch ran up screamin', ""Get the cops, quick!"" (Get the cops, get the cops!)
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', ""Stop it!""
Got clips to stop shit (Shit), rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop (Shot), bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick (Crop pick!)
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits (Yeah)
I shoot a rocket through your optic (What?)
You niggas still don't know the top pick (Top shit!)
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch (Bitch!)
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits (Hot grits)
(No one) — Ain't nobody iller than me

[Chorus: Bizzare, Eminem & Fuzz Scoota]
(No one) Ain't nobody iller than me
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me (Nobody)

Fattest Skinny Kid Alive,"[Intro]
To the Batmobile, let's go
Yo, Manix man, I'ma take this one kinda slow, alright?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Welcome to the flipside
Hope he can swim, 'cause if he can't, he gonna drown in a riptide
It's pourin', plus the old man ain't snoring
'Cause you gotta get up pretty damn early in the morning
'Cause I'm slammin' like Basketball Jones
Slippin' out chrome for messin' with the break bones
You suckers disgust me like low fat
Gimme a bat and I'll show you where your head's at
Tryna hit the row when you paddles, you little Bocce
I think you better stay home and eat your broccoli
'Cause you still got a long ways to go
So you better step off, 'cause you picked the wrong Joe
You ain't ready to throw with the mighty man
And don't forget about the rest of the band
So you better get used to the shrine
'Cause I'll be rappin' as long as I can write rhymes
These rhymes are hand-craft like pottery
To make you see so many stars, you'd think you studyin' astrology
You wanted to live so tell about what you went through
You couldn't cut the mustard if I gave you a Ginsu

[Scratching]

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quickly, step to the side 'cause I'm coming through
And do so much flippin', they call me W&W
So how could you think you outdid me?
While I'm still gettin' rid of waste quicker than a kidney
Steppin' to a rabbit is stupid when you're a turtle
Did you know you couldn't even blow a rhyme in a circle
Little kiddies are getting a bit too frolicky
Throwing me rhymes more sorry than an apology
Test me to talking you right up please
Let me give it the proper operation that it needs
So allow me to put a end to weak melody
Need it for suckers like peanut butter and celery
Friends in the zone with the words that I kick with ease
And leave with the face black feelin' like a Pekinese
And light up your set like Cheers
My mouth more tooth than a sharp pair of shears
And given that, I could love to chop to it
You remember the day you rhymes with the fools
Then you'll know what it's like to take a nosedive
Beat by the fattest skinny kid alive!

[Break: Eminem]
A'ight, we're gonna break it down for a second, and I'ma catch my breath
And I'ma let Butteh Fingiz go off on a scratch for a minute
Dude, Butteh Fingiz, when I give you the cue; come up with that funky-ass-diculous-dope scratch
Go for it

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, let me show you how the big boys play
Thinking 'bout us bustin' out into the fat girl on a Wednesday
While I grab the steel and put you through an ordeal
So kneel before me or fear who's more real
I'll make the best rhyme, look up there's a plaque
Start flowin' so much, I'll be in need of a maxi pad
It went so fast, my pen'll yell at me
Did so many drugs, my song will be a felony
How'd he ever get the nerve to confront me?
Well shit, that's what you get for being clumsy
Get more steppin' up, figure the competition
I got more jerks in my basement than you have twitches
Must you all get played out like Batman
Warped like Pager, crushed by the Fatman
And I takeover like a gossip
Blowin' 'em out so fast, I swear their name was proportion
Smooth as whipped cream but rough as a callous
So I'ma losing it, call me Mr. Malice
With a soul intent for destruction
One more hit for the Downstairs Productions

Steppin’ On To The Scene,"[Verse 1]
Eat 'em
Every time I come back, I’m putting the mask on my head
Beat the sons of a bitches so hard that they forget where they’re at
I ain’t saying the same thing every time I attack
Damn, I just got whooped by a new jack
A New Jack, may be new, let me jack this
[Design?] a few [?] the fact
Of an experience lack
I just ignore 'em
Take my energy and store it
Who want decided to get brave
Then I pour it, pour it
On his ass
Like milk over a wilted plant
Constantly tromping in and around
To get paid again
I drink beer
So, you better steer clear
’Cause I steer and smear
The crip who interferes
Ripping a bastard up in less than a minute
Let’s get hunked by a truck
Suck a straw with answers in it
Suckers are dropping in the back that I stood
I can rhyme while I’m puking and it would still sound good
Even when out of gas
I’m pulling rhymes from my ass
You won't be think as fast enough to talk through the glass
Rain rhymes, you performed a song that you regret
While my money is due, so I can let through the exit
And let's get hangin' at [zen?]
Part of me’s so bad
’Cause I prefer to leave a blur
When I stirred your ass

Don’t Chew With Your Mouth Full,"[Verse 1]
Livin' like a truant, but fluent with ingenuity
Takin' our spaces, the racist leavin' a vacuity
So now I'm [procured?] original, sooner said than done
Drimmin' then better done, to stun the bald headed one
Blind to astonish, I admonish got the trigger, this finger with emotion that's pent up in it
But now, [I'ma dent'm?]
Try and combine a short wick with a quick temper
You're closer to death in the dark with distemper
You trapped no vagile, fragile as a thin branch
You got a better script, better rip or get avalanched
I'm stepping up the fore on my thumb to expand my fist
Quicker than expected, perfected
Delaying with this so clear me a path
And knock you out while doing it
You open your mouth so damn much, your own foot flew in it
You a man or a midget, you should call yourself [Gidgetski?]
The way you be blowing the mic and throwing your shit at me
Old and crusty, dusty as chalk
I should put your ears to your mouth and make you listen to yourself talk
Have you heard you yet? Obviously not
Otherwise you'd realize what a fag you sound like and stop

[Chorus]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
'Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 2]
9-2-3 dash 3-6-9-4, ding-dong, wrong number
Now what you wanna die for?
One man only
Put your right in, it took two
I'm shooting like a freelance and dancin' all over you
Yeah, you bet you I'ma catch you sooner or later I'll find you
Track you down, smack you down, blind you
The heat's dealt, so you're melted before you even felt it
Welted from being belted
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
[Earth?] slackin', I'm throwin' pitches and switches
Which is trickery, victory's repetitious
The weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

[Chorus]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
'Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

[Verse 3]
With the mentality of a gerbil
You, brother, you said you're sad
Your lips are becoming chapped
From suckin' so damn bad
Your fear is a big downpour, as I begin a bright star
And when it takes off in my path
Question, should I break your face and take your place
Sorta transfer the answer, undoubtedly yes
Blockin' your [leadin' crown?], and knockin' you back a mile
You'd swear we were twins, if I'd been over and cracked a smile
I'm going at 'em and splat 'em
Trip 'em and laugh, rip 'em in half
No regroupin', you're troopin'
While I'm stoopin', yet the beams from your forehead
Still shines like a flashlight
Then I'm gonna turn you out, burn you out!
You face defeat
Beat down by brains
I grab your jugular vein to double the pain
You struggle and strain, but it's useless
Collapsed in a lost fight
So hot you smolder, but colder than frostbite

[Verse 4]
You take out crews by yourself, take out this one
I'm a soloist, Chaos is a soloist pick one
Either of us'll put mud tracks in your skull
And put your crew in a pile and stack 'em up like a totem pole
I give you a chance to make a change of direction
Or have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when you're trailing
Your smooth sailing hit a storm, it looks likes your failing
Left a band that's stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded
I'm standing colossal, rag you out like a fossil
With a rap so hot it will cause a snot in your nostril
Take you out, take you out with simplicity
I'm shocking so bad, I'll make you shit electricity
Try and flip me or whip me you fucking sped
Bon appetite, eat the concrete, dickhead

[Chorus]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
'Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes

Unreallistically Graphic,"[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've got divas sleeping at my house like a lodge
Cause after one massage, I hit them with a barrage of flesh they can't dodge
My garage and driveway are filled with parked cars to the street from visitors who didn't survive me
One night stand of loosey-coochie, dying in my animal house with my neighbors like John Belushi
I talk dirty to nuns until they're horny as Satan, and keep them running back there like Walter Payton
Here ya go, here's my number yo, dial M&M for Murder if you wanna undergo
A hard day's night and we can get on it
I pack a full load, and I do ya like laundry
Cause I believe that all bad girls must get spanked
So come gank the clank, and we'll go clackety-clank
And you'll be permanently added to my collection
So I suggest you feed the dogs in front of the lawn before ya check in

[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
See, I may be a youngster but baby I can do the pullup for ya
Physically delirious so get your butt over
Cause like Whitney I've been saving all my love for you
So roll out the the great taste of Pepsi, and get ready for Mountain Dew!
Here's a [?] cause looks can be deceiving
If you look into my eyes you'll be perceiving a sexual demon
And don't measure me in just 12 inches, since it's essential to make you suffer a bit, [?]
So let's put our heads together, we'll come up with something
Jimmy Deans are like raw cut, you're cookin', so
Grab the meat, at a place that's dirt cheap [?] for such a delicacy
You'll be royalty to me if there's loyalty to me baby
Yeah maybe I get this sweaty and salty [?]
We'll get in that heavy-duty bucket
I ain't using protection, I ain't Vanilla Ice, I want the satisfaction!

[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames
Can't you see that I just want the chance to be your fantasy
And if you give me just one night that's all I need to make you mine

[Verse 3: Eminem]
All I'm asking for is one night
And in the heat of the moment, your pants dropped and I do my best work at night
So after seven I can't stop, once I kiss you you'll be wanting me really bad
And how you feel [?] without the natural aphrodisiac
I'll getcha hot [?] rap
[?] getcha hot [?] graduate [?]
[?]
[?] flooded with anxiety
Shouted, ""Oh have mercey"" like, ""Yeah, put it inside of me!""
And once I begin to dig and make that hole twice as big you can't renege
I've got nymphos to where they can't stand sex
Cause I've ended up stretching their muscles like Spandex
Watch 'em squirm like a worm the entire term
Get a firm grip, aim for the eye and shoot sperm!
And all the action got the capability for excitement
But the night ain't done yet, 'till we reach enlightenment
So, yo... do you think you can handle it?

[Chorus: Tim Kelley (V-Top)]
Girl I got to have you and it's driving me insane
I just want to make love until our bodies engulf in flames

Yo, if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
I'm just fucking with you, 'cause I got nothing to do

[Verse 1: Eminem, Eminem w/ Royce da 5'9""]
I came in the diner with skateboarders and placed orders
Ate hors d'œuvres and hit the waiter with plate warmers
Let you inhale the Glock smell while I'm ripping your wallet off
And slipping a Molotov in your cocktail
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face
Smash his glasses and turn 'em to contacts
I'm on some Suge shit; if it's missing, I took it (Whoops)
""Nurse, look at this straitjacket; it's crooked""
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone with a decapitated head
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9""]
Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500, hide from it
For every hundred emcees rhyming about birds
Only about two thirds, I really said it without words
Yo, you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit
You would swear it's raining slugs (What)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (Uh-huh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me, defending me
You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up
You get hit, ten down and ten up (What)
I take it if you run your mouth, then you wanna get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals 'cause of a small name or title (What)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated
It takes six minutes to get applause (Yay)
And by the time you all catch on, I'mma end your career
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on
I'll throw you off of ten floors (Ahhhhh!)
Pull a fucking headache out of my head, and put it in yours (Take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for this acid to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores
This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, ""It oughta happen—
You swallow cum, bitch?"" ""No, but I brought a napkin""
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing 'cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting
I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my U-haul screaming ""You ain't moving here""
Lorena Bobbitt—c'mere, want a souvenir?
I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
""Juvenile?"" Same difference, I need some 'caine
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up to seven slain infants (Oh, my God)
Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same 'cause I traded brains with a chimpanz' (Ohhh!)

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9""]
Walking in swamp water with an M-16
Out for the blood, shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces (What), you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (What)
Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, ice in my vein, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading
I won't die, I'm never leaving (What)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing
Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a death wish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the Tec lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace
For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (What)

King of Detroit, who they namin' the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is comin' soon
MCs get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leavin' all of you cats shittin' kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cockin' pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin' the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packin' semi
Speak darts — yo, you get paid?
Rhymin' about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feelin'
I keep illin', my steez willin' to keep killin'
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks: one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls

The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle'll get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this — and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is gettin' taken advantage of, like Monica Lewinsky (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushin' a ten speed
Screamin' to Aunt Peg
With three spokes stickin' outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowin' you wack
You act up and I'm throwin' you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwin' you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than gettin' hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-fallin' feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

To turn your chest red
With that dick in your mouth, fuckin' everything you just said

Nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands

Locked in youth homes at 6 for Glock bustin'

Makin' sure you get fed with a whole lot of lead
Then throw you off of the Ambassador Bridge
And scream ""DROP DEAD""

Largely I'm out to stack equations
Without a tax evasion
With mossy that's amazin'

Would make a man bleed
Like a cattle pack stampede

Chauvinist pig, drove in this big Lincoln
'Til it went over the bridge
Jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'ma go for your mids, here's a body blow for your ribs
While you're clutchin' your stomach
And bleedin' all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib, then I'ma have both of you did
Burning incense, facin' a murder sentence
Under intense investigation for killin' infants
While I sit in padded rooms, doin' shrooms
Havin' visions of dead pregnant women
With brooms jabbed in they wombs
Slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
Stickin' up Arbor Drugs, and jumpin' in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer layin' up against the dumpster
With a hundred dollar jumper, smothered in Southern Comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screamin' a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her

Ayo, proceed to list 'em, there's no need to diss 'em
Down here we heat 'em, destroy your whole breathing system
Twist 'em, like beer caps, once they hear that

Collapse further states, my track preserve the great
Your pack deserve a crate: in fact, the word is fate
I'll kill you slow like AIDS-infested nuts
I'm holdin' vendetta like seven great-molested sluts
Callin' me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one, how many times you got dropped?
I'm cut-throat when any track runs
Conscious when I smack nuns
The rough neck that make Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic, the sermon preacher
Burnin' emcees, most wanted by Herman Kiefer
You tried to get a squad, they was like, ""Money, oh no.""
Leave you brain-dead, hittin' trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D12 slow flow
Shoot down your mothership and pimp-smack mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle-blades with the renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute-made
My lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow
Big P, the reason emcees cancelled they show
The truth will hurt, seein' Proof at work, no shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad be godly, fearin' shit hardly
So I hope when I'ma die dope like Chris Farley

[Verse 3: Bugz]
Fuck that! Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip for you to come get
Your click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask your girl, they know the scoop: don't fuck with Bugz, bitch!
I'll chop off her titty, have you suckin' one tit
Them pink belly niggas is who you run with
Makin' half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit
You could make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I admit that my style is unfit
For Momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch, I stab you in your armpit
Now, who the nitwit wanna come get with
This egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic?
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bent shit
I smoked a blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Your bitch paid my bill, that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that!

[Verse 4: Supa Emcee]
I kill competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight, my executive decision
Then reminisce on how Shady the business
Terrorists acts by Israelis when they visit
Bombin' the senate, World War III in the makin'
Murdered the exhibition, team finish, beat the ref senseless
No time-out, extended play burns over your intermission
Then christen the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Cryin' for the Messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wig when I top the stove frame, boil sizzlin'
A pyromaniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
When I home improve, you need Bob here to fix it
Fuck school and supervision!
Bit off of financial aid and smoked up my tuition
Only hang around rappers with explicit lyrics
And pistol-grip punks for the beefin' — do you wanna get heated?

[Verse 5: Stilla Shellz]
I got a mind full of troubles, everything's in doubles
I buy my guns in couples, no time for placement fumbles
‘Cause emcees come and emcees go, with broke flow
Injured from head to toe, no fitter model, we full-throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, livin' mathematical
I smash the flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer
Married to marijuana since a minor
Makin' attempts to sink my battleship
Could get you bent like fibs, what?
Applying death-defying feats, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like the sea when I release these beats over concrete

[Verse 6: 0-1]
My presidented transition has taken place
As I express vocally on the M-I-C-R-O
Power he cipher, not equality, I deal it
Lace the track and made it real, now I know my peoples feel it
Keep their heads bobbin' and the emotionals sobbin'
Plus a culture-cipher after shows, hoes slobbin'
Knobs love the fuckin' flavor of the icin'
Plus I'm precise and my double edge continue slicin'",D12
Filthy,"[Intro]
Fucks fat ass, nasty dirty niggas, uhhh
FILTH, shit! Fuckin' filth! Yeah
LA LA LA, la la la la, la LA!

[Verse 1: Proof & Bizarre]
Ayo, my style bust holes in the earth, crush the crust
By the dirtiest, heathen specialize in stoppin' breathin'
My legion'll bleed man, what do you believe in?
(Heaven and Hell) Make your grill swell, it ain't hard to tell
I work spells, all wicked like Gargamel
Put [?] hand first, the red bursts another victim
Nah man, let the morgue pick 'em

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Cancel the hash shit, I'm fillin' my glands full of acid
Two hands full of ass dancin' with Angela Bassett
Make plans for the casket, your head lands in a basket
A dead man's in the plastic, I got red hands and the mask fits
(Yeah Em) Fuckin' rap pervert, I serve dirt
My sick thoughts get all mixed up like rainbow sherbert
Get every nerve hurt - spot a mic and walk toward it
My whole click'll beat yo' fuckin ass and camcord it

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Somebody hide me, too many hoes on my dick
Smoked all your ""Hay,"" who wants to start the Crucial Conflict?
I'm the big daddy smokin' blunts in Cali
Ill enough to do a driveby on a stay in school rally
Stop stop knockin' cause ain't nobody there
Hoes with AIDS I still fuck BARE!
Cause I, I just don't care
I'll enough to fuck up, all yo' dental care
When Bizarre kid comes through, you better yell mayday
While you was havin' ""Good Times,"" I +dyno-mite+ Kujo and J.J

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
HAHA, yeah yeah bitch!
I get helmet from stank crackheads
And read my kids horror stories when I lay 'em to bed
Ridin bikes butt-naked, gettin frisked by policemen
FUCK Christmas - this is take your gift season
Beatin kids up for no reason, take lunch boxes and all
Gettin high off mushrooms and play, ""A Friendly Game of Dodgeball""
BITCH! YEAH! Aiyyo..

[Repeat to fade]
You're battlin the Dirty Dozen, that don't pay
You god damn right punk, stay outta my way",D12
